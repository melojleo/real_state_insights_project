The project in question addresses the creation of a complete solution, in the form of an interactive panel hosted in the cloud, for analysis from the point of view of the company's CEO on which are the best deals available on the market. The dashboard includes visualizations, descriptive statistical analysis, business insights, and buy and sell recommendations.
